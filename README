## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component ![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)
and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Building process 

1. I initialized the project as a public repository on [GitHub]. Created a repo to make it easier to share my code with the community.
2. i Looked through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, i structured my content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. I wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down.
